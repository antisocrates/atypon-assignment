## Getting Started
First, install depedencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Have in mind the following things:
- Pay equal attention, both to the code quality and to the look-and-feel of the deliverable. The result should be pixel-perfectly aligned with the provided design.
- If you don’t have time, prefer to deliver a smaller part of the project rather than delivering a subpar result.
- The project already includes the font, svg icons and images that you will need. Check `public` and `components/icons` directories.
- Feel free to change the file structure if you want, but it will be nice if you aligned your code to the provided structure.

You can deliver the code back either through a .zip or through a repo.

Don’t hesitate to reach out with an email at any time for additional instructions or clarifications.

Good luck!
